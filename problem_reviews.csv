SheIn asks you for measurements and recommends your size but it's way off causing several returns off the bat. That's where the app problems begin. They provide the prepaid label but the quality in the label imaage was poor so I had to print at premium ink so the post office could read, then I used the app to try both the take photo and the upload option of return rcpt but the app wouldn't save either. Still waiting on return credit. Concern.",1,27/04/2023 2:44

But when you find an item that is so good, and a little bit cheap, then, I advice you, to RE look at it. Because some people buy the item, they post pics of the item, and when you see it in real life, you won't like it as much as you thought, because it is obviously diffrent, in a bad way. So please, if this site is about introducing cheap things in a wonderful way, then I don't need to waste my money",1,19/06/2022 11:28

Like they can deliver the products in my place but they can't return pick up from my place which was ridiculous. I even asked them in which part of my city you can pick please let me know so I can return pick up. They were not telling me. Courier was costing me too much. This simply means they are just looting their customers. Also the description and the pictures which they give is not the products which you get delivered at your place.
